# Learning Analytics Dashboard

## Overview
The Learning Analytics Dashboard (LAD) is developed in Unity to provide educators with insights into their students' learning progress while using the [Sorting Game](https://github.com/vdrongow/Master-Project-Game). The dashboard visualizes data collected during the game, helping teachers to adapt their teaching strategies based on real-time analytics.

A demo build is available [here](https://vdrongow.github.io/LA-Dashboard/). 
It requires a desktop browser with support for WebAssembly and WebGL.

## Features
